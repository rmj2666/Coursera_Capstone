INTRODUCTION AND BUSINESS PROBLEM
The capstone assignment project aims to study the business opportunities Paris intra-muros can offer any contractors, especially in the domain of foods and restaurations but also for any other good deals.


The district is an administrative division, headed by an elected mayor. There are only three cities in France where there are arrondissements, Paris, Lyon and Marseille.

The division of Paris into districts dates from 1795. At that time there were only twelve districts. By the annexation of suburbs and villages in Paris the number rose to twenty in 1859.

Nowadays the population of certain districts corresponds to big cities. Thus in the 19th arrondissement the population of approximately 180000 inhabitants is the equivalent of Le Havre or Reims. But in the 1st district (Louvre) there are only about 17000 inhabitants and in the 8th approximately (Elysées) that 40000 inhabitants.

Madame Hidalgo, mayor of Paris, wants the merger of the first four districts.

The districts form a spiral, a snail shell, starting from the center outwards and turning in the direction of the needles of an old clock. The 1st district is in the center, and the 20th district in the east.

In the 1st district is the Louvre former palace became museum, the Forum des Halles in the place des Halles, the church St Eustache, the Palais-Royal and the Palace of Justice in the Ile de la Cité.

The Paris City Hall is located in the 4th arrondissement.

In the 8th arrondissement is the Arc de Triomphe, the Champs-Elysées, the Place de la Concorde, the Church of the Madeleine and of course the Elysee Palace seat of the Presidency of the Republic.

The Eiffel Tower is located in the 7th round on the left bank of the Seine, as the Hotel Matignon where the Prime Minister works, the Bourbon Palace seat of the National Assembly, the Musée d'Orsay where are exposed many painters Impressionists, the Invalides where is the tomb of Napoleon and the museum of Quai Branly - Jacques Chirac (Museum of Arts and Civilizations of Africa, Asia, Oceania and the Americas).

The basilica of the Sacred Heart of Montmartre overlooking Paris is in the 18th arrondissement.

For each district there are clichés: the 16th arrondissement is the "rich", the 5th is the universities, the 11th (where is the concert hall "Bataclan" that the terrorists attacked on November 13, 2015 making 90 deaths) has become a trendy district where you meet at the end of the week for a drink. The 13th is Chinatown. While the 18th, the 19th and the 20th are popular neighborhoods.

But Paris did not always have the shape of a snail. There were 9 districts on the right bank of the Seine and 3 on the left bank. The 1st district was towards the Champs-Elysées including the Tuileries, the Place Vendôme. The Palais-Royal was in the 2nd. The Louvre in the 4th. The Sorbonne, Luxembourg in the 11th arrondissement.

And so in 1860 the boroughs became a snail. As Paris grew larger, the outer boroughs grew to reach the present limits.
